        Hello and thank you for using my app!\nI
        am a computer science student at the University of Washington and have been a clarinet
        teacher for the last few years.\n\nOne
        of the main reason I built this app is that learning to read notes is actually not
        that fun. This is a simple app that gamifies the note learning
        process. I really hope you enjoy using it!
